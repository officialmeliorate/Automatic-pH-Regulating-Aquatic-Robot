The aquatic robot is capable of monitoring the pH level of water and it continuously display the pH value using LCD display and it automatically regulates the pH of water between 6.5 and 9. The robot is controlled using our mobile phone via bluetooth technology.
For this project we are using arduino uno, L298 motordriver module, pH sensor and submerssible pumps.
