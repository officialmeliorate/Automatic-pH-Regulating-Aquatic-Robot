The aquatic robot is capable of monitoring the pH level of water and it continuously display the pH value using LCD display and it automatically regulates the pH of water between 6.5 and 9. The robot is controlled using our mobile phone via bluetooth technology.
For this project we are using arduino uno, L298 motordriver module, pH sensor and submerssible pumps. 

The system automatically adjusts pH levels to maintain optimal conditions for aquatic organisms. pH is maintained between 6.5 to 9 inwhich if pH goes below 6.5, the motordriver ic activates the submersible pump and discharges the liquid to increases the pH. If pH goes above 9, the motordriver ic activates the submersible pump and discharges the liquid to decreases the pH.
